## Implementing utility functions

#Bounding boxes can be represented in multiple ways, the most common formats are:

#- Storing the coordinates of the corners `[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]`
#- Storing the coordinates of the center and the box dimensions
#`[x, y, width, height]`

#Since we require both formats, we will be implementing functions for converting
#between the formats.
